# Advent of Code 2025 – Solutions 🎄

This repository contains my personal solutions for **Advent of Code 2025**. All solutions are implemented either in **Java** or **Python**, depending on the day. Each solution is written with readability and clarity in mind so that I can reference them later or showcase them as part of my portfolio.

Feel free to clone the repository and run any day's solution with your own input files.

## 🚀 How to Run the Solutions

### **Java Solutions**

Some days are implemented in Java. To compile and run them:

Replace `dayX` with the appropriate folder (e.g., `day1`, `day2`).

### **Python Solutions**

Some days are implemented in Python. To run them:

```bash
python3 dayN/dayN.py
